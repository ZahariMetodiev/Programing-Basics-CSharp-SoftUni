# **Programing-Basics-CSharp-SoftUni**

## _For the course_
---
_The "Programming Basics" course provides the initial programming skills necessary for all technology majors at Software University. This includes writing programming code at an entry level (basic coding skills), working with a development environment (IDE), using variables and data, operators and expressions, working with the console (reading input data and printing results), using conditional constructs (if, if-else) and loops (for, while, do-while)._

## _The skills I have acquired_
---
* Working with the console (data input and output)
* Working with loops (for)
* Work with more complex logical conditional statements
* Working with logical conditional statements (if-else)
* Perform simple calculations
* Working with more complex loops (nested for loops and while)

## _Topics covered in this course_
---
* First Steps in Coding
* Conditional Statements
* Conditional Statements Advanced
* For Loop
* While Loop
* Nested Loops

## _Here you can find problem solutions for the following exercises._
